# Definitive Ktor template

The target of this project is to prepare a Real world example of Kotlin backend development, libraries and tools used can change in the course of making this template. I would like to achieve a base project for my personal projects, a point to start with a lot of work done it.

What did taken into account to choose this tech stack?
1) Stability of library.
2) Library must be preferably DSL or DSL friendly.
3) Compatible with Kotlin Native if possible.
4) Open software.
5) Easy to use.
